## *Step 1: Simulate Transaction Data*

*We simulate 10 shopping transactions involving grocery items.*

* Each transaction contains between **2 to 5 items**.
* Items are selected from a pool of **10 unique products**.
* These transactions will be used for frequent itemset mining and association rule generation.

```python
transactions = [
    ["Bread", "Milk", "Eggs"],
    ["Bread", "Milk"],
    ["Bread", "Milk", "Butter"],
    ["Eggs", "Cheese", "Butter"],
    ["Bread", "Eggs", "Juice"],
    ["Milk", "Cheese"],
    ["Bread", "Milk", "Eggs"],
    ["Juice", "Apples"],
    ["Bread", "Milk"],
    ["Eggs", "Butter"]
]
```

---

## *Step 2: Analyze with Apriori*

### *Create a Unique Item List*

```python
all_items = sorted(set(item for transaction in transactions for item in transaction))
```

*Extracts and sorts all unique items from the transactions. This gives a complete reference list of all possible products for encoding.*

### *One-Hot Encode the Transaction Data*

```python
encoded_data = [{item: (item in transaction) for item in all_items} for transaction in transactions]
df = pd.DataFrame(encoded_data)
```

*Each transaction is encoded into a dictionary where each product is marked as `True` if present and `False` otherwise. The result is converted into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.*

---

## *Step 3: Generate Association Rules*

### *Metric: confidence and Minimum threshold: 0.7*

```python
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori, association_rules
frequent_itemsets = apriori(df, min_support=0.3, use_colnames=True)
rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets, metric='confidence', min_threshold=0.7)
```

*This step uses the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets and then generates rules. A rule is only kept if its confidence is **70% or higher**.*

---

## *Final Output: Frequent Itemsets and Association Rules*

### Frequent Itemsets

| Support | Itemsets       |
| ------- | -------------- |
| 0.6     | (Bread)        |
| 0.6     | (Milk)         |
| 0.5     | (Eggs)         |
| 0.5     | (Bread, Milk)  |
| 0.3     | (Eggs, Butter) |

### Association Rules

| Antecedents | Consequents | Support | Confidence | Lift |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| Milk        | Bread       | 0.5     | 0.83       | 1.39 |
| Bread       | Milk        | 0.5     | 0.83       | 1.39 |

## *Understanding Confidence and Lift — as chosen rules*

---

### *Confidence*

Confidence measures how often the rule has been observed to be true.

$$
\text{Confidence}(\text{Milk} \rightarrow \text{Bread}) = \frac{\text{Support}(\text{Milk ∩ Bread})}{\text{Support}(\text{Milk})}
$$

In our data:

* Support(Milk ∩ Bread) = 0.5 → Both items appear together in 50% of transactions.
* Support(Milk) = 0.6 → Milk appears in 60% of all transactions.

$$
\text{Confidence} = 0.5 / 0.6 = 0.83 \ (83\%)
$$

**Interpretation:** When Milk is purchased, Bread is also purchased **83% of the time**.

---

### *Lift*

Lift measures how much more likely Bread is to be bought when Milk is bought, compared to buying Bread at random.

$$
\text{Lift}(\text{Milk} \rightarrow \text{Bread}) = \frac{\text{Confidence}(\text{Milk} \rightarrow \text{Bread})}{\text{Support}(\text{Bread})}
$$

* Support(Bread) = 0.6
* Lift = 1.39

**Interpretation:**
Customers who buy Milk are **1.39 times more likely** to also buy Bread compared to random chance.

---

## *Explanation of the Association Rule Mining Process*

This process discovers patterns in transactional data. Each rule connects an antecedent ("if" part) with a consequent ("then" part), showing how likely they are to occur together. Rules with confidence ≥ 70% and lift > 1 are considered strong and useful for uncovering customer buying patterns.
